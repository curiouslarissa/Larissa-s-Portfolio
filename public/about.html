        <h1>About Larissa</h1>
        <br />
       <p> I always knew I was very good in learning languages. Assimilating different codes of a language 
        and translations always came naturally to me, I just never thought
        before about the possibility of learning coding itself, however, my interest for Neuroscience
        and the advance of AI sparked more and more my interest to give it a try.</p>

        <p>I'm a 29-year-old, currently based in Germany and this is my first little adventure 
        into the world of coding.</p>
